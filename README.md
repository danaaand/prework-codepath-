## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- iMessage:
    - message effects when sending
    - 
- spotify
    - move between devices while listening
    - offline download playlists
- google maps
    - traffic information and changes to route according to it
    - routes for different transportation types
    
    
I want to create a travel app designed to help users plan and organize their trips more efficiently. The app would allow users to add destinations, routes, and travel times between locations. Using this information, users could create a detailed travel schedule.



## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

location of codes I needed to include was confusing. (outside of class, inside the function, etc)
